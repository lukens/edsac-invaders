# Edsac Invaders
A Space Invaders animation written for [the Edsac simulator](http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~edsac/).

I wrote this in 1999 for a History of Computing assignment whilst in the final year of my Computer Science degree at the Universty or Warwick.

I'm pretty sure I understood it at the time, but the course lecturer was right, I needed more comments in my code.
