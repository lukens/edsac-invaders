# Edsac Invaders
A Space Invaders animation written for [the Edsac simulator](http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~edsac/).

I wrote this in 1999 for a History of Computing assignment whilst in the final year of my Computer Science degree at the Universty or Warwick.

I'm pretty sure I understood it at the time, but the course lecturer was right, I needed more comments in my code.

[Wikipedia has this to say about Edsac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_delay_storage_automatic_calculator):

> The electronic delay storage automatic calculator (EDSAC) was an early British computer. Inspired by John von Neumann's seminal First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC, the machine was constructed by Maurice Wilkes and his team at the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in England. EDSAC was the second electronic digital stored-program computer to go into regular service.
